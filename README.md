# Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning

In this Design oriented project, various machine learning approaches are studied in
the context of image classification. Here we aim at standardizing a machine learning
model using multiple existing neural networks to understand and classify various
types of Brain tumor, namely meningioma, glioma and pituitary tumor. Here we
begin by extracting a dataset, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and conclude
useful insights from the extracted dataset. The aim is to club one or more of these
existing models into layers and design a model that can classify a given MRI dataset
into a meningioma, glioma or a pituitary tumor case. The initial parameters are taken
according to the image resolution and later optimized according to requirements.
